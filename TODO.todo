  Potential Enhancements

  1. Provider Priority: Consider adding a "primary_provider" field to handle users who authenticate through multiple providers.
  2. Field Cleanup: Maybe add a helper to remove provider fields when a user unlinks that provider.
  3. Migration Safety: The automatic column creation via RestApiKnexPlugin is convenient, but you might want provider plugins to check if their
  fields already exist before extending.

  
☐ Delete "Creating Custom Storage Plugins for JSON REST API", make an op plugin instead.
☐ Improve the look of the CSS, especially black and long code fragments, title fonts
☐ Check manually that the API is OK 
☐ Check that the guide has full coverage of features, map the missing parts
